# CSPB-3287-LAB-1

In this problem set, you're going to author 10 SQL queries within a Python notebook. 

1. You should CLONE this repository to your https://coding.csel.io  virtual machine for this course.  You should open the notebook ```Lab1.ipynb``` and carefully read the instructions.  

2. We have provided a database (```flights.db```) that can be used with SQLite for the first assignment. The assignment is completely contained within the local environment (no need to access an outside server).  The database file (```flights.db.bz2```) has been compressed using the bzip2 program on Linux. You should start a terminal and issue the following Linux command to uncompress the database: 

        bunzip2 flights.db.bz2

3. Follow the directions in ```Lab1.ipynb``` to insure you proceed to answer all the questions in the notebook.

4. As you complete your answer to each question (modify the cells in the notebook), save your changes, COMMIT your changes to your local repository, and PUSH the changes to the remote repository on the GitHub Classroom server.  Saving your changes often will keep you from losing your work through accidents.  Pushing the changes to the remote keeps you from worrying about individual computer failure.  

5. If you are having trouble with a question, we will have you commit and push your current code to the remote repository.  This will allow the instructors to access your code.  While real-time meetings, such  as office hours, are the best way to help you with problems, there are times when asynchronous communications work the best.  The access to your work is the main reason that we use the GitHub Classroom. 

6. We will use your remote Git classroom repository to grade your assignments. 
    * Make sure to `commit` your file often to save working code in your notebook.
    * Make sure to `push` your local repository to the remote Git classroom repository.
    * You should submit a printout of your assignment to Moodle.
        * print out the notebook as a PDF (from the HTML version, as described in the notebook) 
        * load that PDF into the Moodle assignment page

    * You can `commit` your assignment as many times as you like, but you must `push` your final submission to the Git classroom remote respoitory before the deadline.
